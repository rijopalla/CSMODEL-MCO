    "The dataset acquired covers the possible key indicators of heart disease among US citizens. The dataset is a public online resource available on Kaggle.com and was acquired from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), a government organization of the United States taking part in the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS). The data was acquired observationally as there was no form of treatment applied to the respondents. The collection was done via an annual telephone survey in all 50 states plus the District of Columbia and three more U.S. territories. Moreso, the dataset contains 319,795 rows and 18 columns with each row representing an observation of a person and the columns representing the responses of the individual to different questions about their health status. The answers of the respondents are valued as 9 booleans, 5 strings, and 4 decimals. No other external files are combined with the single file for this machine project. "

Because of the small p-value and the high chi-statistic value (which is higher than the critical values of 0.01 , 0.05 and 0.10), it can be concluded that, there is a correlation between the two variables, HeartDisease and Smoking, at the significance levels of 0.01, 0.05 and 0.10."

The Philippine Statistics Authority reported that 125,913 (17.9%) of the deaths during the pandemic died because of ischemic heart disease. Ranked after heart disease are: cerebrovascular disease (68,180 or 9.7%) and the Covid-19 virus (8,390 or 1.5%) (Kabagani, 2022). \n",

Some of the mentioned risk factors are already present in the dataset, thus, the main goal for this research is to validate these claims through the given dataset and find other features that are potential risk factors."
